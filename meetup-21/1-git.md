# Git

## Summary

We're doing something a little different today. Instead of an algorithm, we want you to learn git.

What is git?

It is a version control program that is ubiquitous for software engineers. Invented by the same guy who created Linux, git is now akin to oxygen for modern developers. We use it in our projects to track changes, coordinate with others, and stay organized.

We'll provide some resources below to get you started, but *don't limit yourself to just those*. There are tons of awesome blogs, websites, and videos out there. Look for what makes sense to you. The way one article explains git may not make as much sense to you as another article.

## Command Line

In order to use git, you need to be a little bit familiar with the command line. Here are some resources:

* [Conquering the Command Line](freecodecamp.org/news/conquering-the-command-line-f85f5e46c07c/)
* [Codecademy: Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

## Activity

Try to do the following. It will take a bit of googling and a bit of research on your part.

1. Make a GitHub account
1. Star this repository ü§£‚≠êÔ∏è
1. *Fork* this repository
1. *Clone* the forked repository onto your computer
1. Use command line to navigate to that cloned repository on your computer
1. In the `meetup-21/git-pulls` folder, make a new ‚Ä¢markdown* file, name it whatever you want
    * Bonus points if you can do this via command line
1. Add some text and save it!
1. Make a commit using git
1. Push it to your remote repository (that's the forked repository on GitHub)
1. Make a pull request to the original Code Chrysalis repository. Make sure the title of your first pull request is "My First Pull Request".
1. Celebrate!
