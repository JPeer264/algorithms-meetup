# Simple Cipher

Write a function that takes an input string of alphabet characters `base` and a number `offset`, and converts them to a new string with each character changed based on the offset.

If the character offset passes the letter "z", then the cipher loops around to "a"

Example
```
input: "hello", 3

output: "khoor"

input: "world", 5

output: "btwqi"
```
